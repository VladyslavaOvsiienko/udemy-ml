Hi, after completing the course "Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-On Python & R in Data Science" https://www.udemy.com/, I decided to apply the gained knowledge  and everything that I found on the Internet about the algorithms used in practice. 
It includes topics such as Regression (Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression), Classification (Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification), Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering), Association Rule Learning (Apriori, Eclat), Reinforcement learning (Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling), NLP (Bag-Of-Words Model), Deep Learning (ANN, CNN), Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA), Cross-validation and GridSearch, Xgboost. 
Data sets were son-in-law or from the repository (all links are provided) or directly from the course. Python and libraries were used to accomplish this practice: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn, tensorflow, xgboost, etc.
